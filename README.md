For DS-UA 301: Advanced Topics in ML &amp; Deep Learning

Our main objective for this project is to build a robust algorithmic trading model that can accurately maximize profit despite volatile market conditions. We will reference features from other deep learning trading systems that we deem necessary to implement a robust model. Our main focus when developing the model will be accuracy in predicting price and to maximize profit in the form of calculating reward using Deep Q-Learning (DQN). Our model will try to find a correlation between training volume and improved profit and loss.
